  USAGE / LIBRARY REFERENCE
===============================================================================

See the file docs/usage for a brief explanation of each function.
The see docs/example*.c for a examples of the library in use.

===============================================================================
  INSTALLATION
===============================================================================

The Makefile will compile configure.c to detect endian-ness and then will 
compile and create either a shared object, a static library or a test binary.

$ make -B OPT=true liblighashtable.so
$ make -B OPT=true liblighashtable.a
$ make -B OPT=true ht_test

Building the target 'test' will have make also run the test program.
$ make -B OPT=true test

Building 'all' creates both static & shared libraries, a test binary, and 
runs it
$ make -B OPT=true all

If the test fails for whatever reason, it will exit with a non zero code and
this will cause make to print an error.

The following other options are availiable:

Print a large amount of debugging information from the test program
$ make -B DEBUG=true test

Compile with -pg and a large number of test program repetitions
$ make -B BENCHMARK=true OPT=true ht_test
$ time ./ht_test
$ gprof ht_test

Note that compiling BENCHMARK=true without OPT=true will produce interestingly
differnet results - the introduction of -O2 dramatically improves this 
library's performance.
